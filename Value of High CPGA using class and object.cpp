4. Create a class called Student1 and a class called Student2 each containing, as a private
variable, the grade of the students. High_CGPA (), which is a friend function of both the
Student1 and Student2 classes. This function returns positive if the Student1 has higher
cgpa than Student2, if same then 0, and negative if Student2 has higher cgpa than Student1.

i. User will input grades for both Student1 and Student2 members
ii. Print return value of High_CGPA () for (i) scenario.
